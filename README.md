my-first-recursion
==================

Some code I wrote with my recursion code that I wrote in Python.  I am pretty proud of this and quite happy to put this on GitHub.  

The script I wrote takes an array, made up of ints and arrays of ints, and returns the value of all ints summed.  It took me quite a while to get this right.
